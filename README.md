# Genetic_algorithm_parallelization

The problem at hand is a simple string matching genetic algorithm. The objective is to evolve a population of strings to match a target string. This involves generating an initial population, evaluating the fitness of each individual in the population, selecting parents for reproduction based on their fitness, performing crossover and mutation operations, and repeating this process over multiple generations while parallelizing each generations function to achieve maximum compute speed to perform the string matching.
